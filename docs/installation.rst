Installation
============

Required dependencies
---------------------

* netCDF4_ 

* sh_ 

.. _netCDF4: https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python
.. _sh: https://github.com/amoffat/sh

Installation
------------

If you are lucky simple ::

    pip install fixnc

should install dependencies and fixnc itself. However there is a big chance, that netcdf4 will have some problems. 

The better way is to first install netcdf4 with Miniconda_ and then pip install fixnc.

.. _Miniconda: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html



And you always can just clone github `repository`_ .
